# GraphPlotter
A java program that reads the formula of a mathematical function and outputs its graph in the terminal.

The class CelMaiCelExpressionString.java converts the mathematical formula written in an unambiguous algebraic grammar I invented(ex: 1/(1+e^(-x)) is div 1 sum 1 pow e sub 0 x) and turns it into a calculation.

The class CelMaiCelPlotGraph plots the function based on the formula, XY scale and XY dimensions.
